# HR-DATAT-ANALYSIS

This repository contains a comprehensive project for predicting employee turnover within a company using machine learning. The project involves several key components:

**Data Quality Check**: Ensures the dataset is clean by identifying and addressing missing values.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzes and visualizes factors contributing to employee turnover to understand patterns and trends.

**Clustering Analysis:** Groups employees who have left based on satisfaction and performance metrics to identify common characteristics.

**Class Imbalance Handling:** Uses the SMOTE technique to address class imbalance in the dataset, enhancing model performance.

**Model Training and Evaluation:** Applies k-fold cross-validation to train and assess various machine learning models, selecting the best one based on performance metrics.

**Retention Strategies:** Provides actionable strategies for improving employee retention based on the analysis and model insights.

The project is designed to help HR departments predict and mitigate employee turnover by leveraging data-driven insights. It includes scripts for data processing, model building, and strategy formulation.
